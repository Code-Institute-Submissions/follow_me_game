# Follow Me Game

The focus of this project is to create a memory game for children to play. My aim is to build this using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.


## UX

This website is to be a memory game aimed at children to play.

### User Stories:

A game to test the memory of the user. The level of difficulty increases as the user gets the sequence correct and the level increases.

Below is the link for the wire frames I used during the project using Adobe XD

Whilst programming the first wireframe I realised that it was not very appealing so I changed my design to the second wireframe.

## Features

The start button starts the sequence of the game, starting level one with just one button to be pressed. As the user gets the correct sequence another button is included in the sequence increasing the difficulty of the level. Each button has a picture of an animal and as the button is activated the sound of that animal is played. 

### Existing features

There are six levels which need to be replecated correctly for the user to win.

### Feature Left to Implement

• Add and program a reset button
